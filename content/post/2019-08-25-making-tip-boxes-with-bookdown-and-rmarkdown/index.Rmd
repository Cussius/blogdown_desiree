While interning at Rstudio this summer, one of the many tricks I learned was how to create pretty tip boxes (aka custom blocks, sidebars, or as I like to call them, div tips) for your R Markdown, bookdown, or Distill site.

Here is a **div tip**:

## Under the hood

These are Pandoc style custom divs, so they will work with any R Markdown flavored doc that uses Pandoc. (This means it will work with any R markdown document or site, bookdown, and Distill-- but not xaringan or blogdown).  

Bookdown has some that are [built-in](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html), but there's a good chance the built-in div tips may not jive with your site's aesthetic. I learned that you could customize these from [Alison Hill](https://twitter.com/apreshill) who learned from the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) and whose [commit history](https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs/commit/6087b1450b09141085aa10e2d249fc0570e9f529) you can also check out. 

## Why use div tips?
You can interject different versions of these little buddies throughout your site to point out notes, common mistakes, workflow shortcuts, or critical thinking questions (just to name a few ideas) for your reader. 

This makes your content more user-friendly, and as an added bonus--using div tips gives you another opportunity to add more color and personalization to your site.  

And now it's time for me to walk you through some CSS so that you too can make your own pretty div tips!  


## Making your own

**What you need:**

1. CSS
2. To link up your CSS file with your YAML
3. Some small icon files to use for each different kind of div tip you want to make. 

Let's make some!


## Infrastructure

First we make a CSS file and link it up to our YAML. I'll show you how to do this whether you're working in an R Markdown document, Distill site, or bookdown  as your output.

1. If you don't already have one, **create a CSS file** by going to *File* > *New File* > *Text File*.
1. **Name** this file `style.css` (you can choose a different name) and save it in your project directory.
1. **Link** your CSS file in your YAML:  

\

**For R Markdown or Distill**  

If you're working in an R Markdown or a Distill site, then you'll want to open the file `_site.yml` and add the following as part of your output. (Or, if you're not making a site and are instead working with an individual R Markdown document, then you'd add this to the YAML frontmatter of your R Markdown doc.)

    
```{r echo = FALSE}
    yml_empty() %>%
     yml_output(html_document(css = "style.css")) %>% 
      asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```

\

**For bookdown**  

If you're working in bookdown, do this by making sure your `_output.yml` has this:

```{r echo = FALSE} 
yml_empty() %>%
  yml_output(
    bookdown::gitbook(css = "style.css")) %>% 
    asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)

```
  
Okay, now that we've got that setup out of the way, we can start thinking about what to put in our CSS file to style our div tips.


## Anatomy of a div tip

![](div-tip_annotate.png) 

Here's a visual overview of the things that the CSS below specifies. But the only properties you really need to think about changing for quick customization are the ones below. You can choose these ahead of time.

1. `background-color:` You can use the [hexcode color value](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) for any background color that your heart desires.  

1. `color:` ^ Sames goes for the color of the text in your div tip.  

1. `border:` Of course, you don't have to choose a border, but there are some fun options to play with. Thickness and color are self-explanatory, but you may not know about being to choose the border's style (see [options here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border/), e.g. `dotted`,`dashed`, `double`, or if you're feeling wild see what happens when you specify more than one).  

1. `background-image`, which we'll add in a minute.  


## Addings CSS styles

Let's create 4 div tips: a puzzle one, an FYI/background info one, one to use as a placeholder for a livecoding demo, and one for general tips. 

1. **Open** up `style.css` and paste the the CSS below into the file.
1. **Paste** the CSS below into this file.

    ```style.css
    /* -----------div tips------------- */

      div.puzzle, div.fyi, div.demo, div.note {
        padding: 1em;
        margin: 1em 0;
        padding-left: 100px;
        background-size: 70px;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: 15px center;
        min-height: 120px;
        color: #1f5386;
        background-color: #bed3ec;
        border: solid 5px #dfedff;
      }
    ```
    
1. Optionally, **give each div tip a different name** by changing the words after `div.`. You'll have to use this name later as you make content, so go with something short and sweet.  

1. **Change the CSS property values** for `background-color:`, `color:`, and `border:` to suit your preferences. All four div tips will have these features. 
    * Though we don't cover it here, you could also consider giving your div tips a different font than rest of your site by [choosing a Google font](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14676613/how-to-import-google-web-font-in-css-file) and specifying the `font-family:` property in the CSS above.


## Add div tip icons

I like to choose a different background image for each div tip, so I create a new style rule for each div tip so that I can give each one its own icon. 

1. **Pick an image** for each of your div tips.
    * Don't have images? You can download the ones that I've made [here](div-icons.zip), or you can download some free open-source ones [here](http://aiconica.net/).
    * Use `.PNG` images with transparent backgrounds so it doesn't clash with your background. 
1. **Save** the images in your project directory.
1. **Open** `style.css`.
1. **Paste** the style rules below into your CSS.

    ```style.css
    div.puzzle {
      background-image: url("Your-turn.png");
    }
    
    div.fyi {
     background-image: url("fyi.png");
    }
    
    div.demo {
      background-image: url("Live-code.png");
    }
    
    div.note {
      background-image: url("lightbulb.png");
    }
    ```
4. **Change** the file path within the `url()` field for each div tip style so that it points to the image that you want to use.  


## Use your div tips

Now you're ready to start div-tippin'. Using them in your site, blog, or book is simple. Start off with three colons `:::`, followed by the name that you gave each div tip, and then close it off with another set of three colons `:::`. Like this:

```
:::puzzle
My content goes in here!
:::
```

Here are the four div tips we made:
