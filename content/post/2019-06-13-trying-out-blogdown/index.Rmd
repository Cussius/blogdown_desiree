# Hello!
Hi! This is my very first blog post using an R Markdown file within blogdown. I'm going to demonstrate how we can include the following in a single post:

1) R code
2) A plot
3) An image (via markdown syntax)
4) An image (via `knitr::include_graphics`)
5) A relative link to another section in my site
6) A demo using a dataset that I have read in


# 1) Iris data set
Let's make a plot using the `iris` data set in `ggplot2`.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Dataset
head(iris)

```

# 2) Plotting
```{r}

scatter <- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x= Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
scatter + geom_point(aes(color=Species, shape=Species)) +
  xlab("Sepal Length") + ylab("Sepal Width")

```

# 3) Embedding a bundled image

Using markdown syntax `![Photo by Valentin Lacoste on Unsplash](valentin-lacoste-1675701-unsplash.jpg` to generate the image below:

I'm still wondering how to get the caption to show up when I embed images in this way.

<center> ![Photo by Valentin Lacoste on Unsplash](valentin-lacoste-1675701-unsplash.jpg){width=500px} </center>

# 4) Using knitr

We can also accomplish this with a code chunk, setting the following parameter `out.width="500px", fig.align='center'`
```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("valentin-lacoste-1675701-unsplash.jpg")
```


# 5) Relative links 

I can also include some relative links to, for example, tell you check out this [other section of my site](../../project_landing/)!
